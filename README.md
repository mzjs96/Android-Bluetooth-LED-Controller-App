# Android-Bluetooth-LED-Controller-App

This is a very succinct Android app (only two activities, one for setup, one for transmitting data) for communicating from Android phone from HC-06 classical bluetooth receiver to Arduino Uno.

The purpose is to transmit data from phone to arduino using classical bluetooth. I am implementing it for controlling LED light.
